# CityService

The CityService microservice is designed to manage city data, leveraging various modern Java technologies such as Spring Framework, Project Lombok, and WebFlux for reactive programming.
It provides a RESTful API for CRUD Operations on city entities.

## Technologies Used:

- __Spring Framework:__ Core Framework for building enterprise Java applications.
- __Project Lombok:__ Library for reducing boilerplate code in Java.
- __Spring WebFlux:__ Provides reactive programming support for building asynchronous, non-blocking web applications.
- __Spring Data R2DBC:__ Spring Data module for reactive database access using R2DBC
- __MapStruct:__ Used for mapping between domain entities and DTOs.
- __H2 Database:__ In-memory relational database for development and testing purposes
- __JUnit5:__ Testing framework for unit and integration testing in Java.
- __Spring Boot Test:__ Provides testing support for Spring Boot applications.
- __R2DBC (Reactive Relational Database Connectivity):__ Reactive database driver for relational databases.
- __JSON:__ Data interchange format for communication between the client and the server.


 #### This project showcases modern Java development practices, emphasizing reactive programming and clean architecture for building scalable and maintainable microservices.
